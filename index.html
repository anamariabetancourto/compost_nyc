    <!-- BODY OF THE STORY GOES HERE - KEEP IT CUTE! -->

    <p> Starting October 6, all New York property owners must separate organic waste and place it in brown bins required for each building.</p>

    <p> The NYC Department of Sanitation (DSNY) has worked to inform the community of the new measures, but in 2023, it reported only a 4.1% organic waste collection rate in Queens, the first borough to adopt composting.</p> 

    <p> “We have done extensive coverage in the media, shared information on multiple social networks and with public officials, sent flyers by mail, knocked on doors of buildings with one to nine units, and organized several informational sessions with residents and building managers”, said DSNY spokesperson, Vincent Gragnani.</p>

    <p> Nevertheless, the city’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YWXnHT470uK3BX9um6X0B-932AdQzXExOjaxo049haE/edit?usp=drive_link">composting rates </a>  have been increasing significantly since Queens started to receive the service in 2022.</p> 

    <p> The following chart illustrates the increase of composting rates in the city. </p>
